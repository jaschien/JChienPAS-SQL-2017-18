Today, we practiced developing an entity-relationship (ER) diagrams for the poke center. We established tables for different entities, such as customers, transactions, centers, regions, and services. Through the activity, we figured the relationship types between entities and also realized the importance of giving IDs to the entities.

Today, we discussed three aspects of an ER diagram – attributes, entities, and relationships. There are multiple ways in which one can classify attributes. First, attributes can be classified either as simple or composite. A composite attribute is made of many simple attributes, and an example of a composite attribute is address. Further, an attribute can also be single valued or multivalued. For instance, while "highest level of education" is single-valued, "educational degrees" is multivalued. Attributes can also be stored or derived. For instance, "birthdate" is a stored attribute while "age" can be derived from birthdate. Lastly, complex attributes are attributes that use multiple other attributes and are usually derived. When discussing complex attributes, the notion of a null value was also brought up. Under the condition that there is no value for a certain attribute, a null value should be used instead of 0 or blank. Next, we moved on to discuss entities. An important aspect to note about entities is that all entities must have their own IDs as a key attribute. The value sets of entities should also have domains and set null values. Lastly, there are three types of relationships: 1:1, 1:M, and M:M. While a relatioship usually occurs between two different entities, it is possible for the same entity to participate in the relationship. In this case, the relationship is recursive as an entity refers to itself again in the table. Finally, we discussed ER notations – One would generally put a diamond around an action/verb that describes the relationship between two entities, and put a square around an entity.
